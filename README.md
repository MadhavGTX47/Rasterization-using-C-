# Rasterization-using-C-
A simple rasterizer for basic shapes in c++ 


How to run:-

First run the make raster command to generate raster
then use any flags to generate desired image

Basic Assignment:-
 
Use:	```make raster``` 
	
to generate out file 
the output is "raster"

Use:	```raster teapot-3.nff```
	for basic output

the output is "output.ppm"

Use: ``` raster -t 0.65 teapot-3.nff```
      for transparency and the number 0.65 can be replaced by desired value		
      Here the output is "output.ppm"



Note:-
Reused the structuring and some part of Assig-2 Raytracer
Has done, extra credit transparency
